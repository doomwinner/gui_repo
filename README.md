# GUI Applications through Tkinter library

My repository contains three Python scripts that demonstrate three different graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the Tkinter library in Python. Each script showcases a different geometry manager available in Tkinter: pack, grid, and place.

## Files:

1. `pack.py`: This script creates a simple calculator interface using the pack geometry manager. It features an entry box for displaying numbers and buttons for numerical input and basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. `grid.py`: This script demonstrates a sign-up page using the grid geometry manager. It includes text boxes for entering name, email, and password, along with a "Sign Up Now" button. The "Sign Up Now" button also randomly changes font, font size, and font weight every 500 miliseconds or 0.5 seconds.

3. `place.py`: This script implements a login page using the place geometry manager. It features text boxes for entering username and password, along with a "Login" button.

## Running the Scripts:

To run any of these scripts, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can run each script by executing it with the Python interpreter. For example:

python pack.py
python grid.py
python place.py
